# odin-recipes
This repository follows along the "The Odin Project: Foundations" course.

During the "HTML Foundaions" chapter, we learned how to:

* Present a basic webpage
* Insert links and images
* Insert numbered and bullet-point lists
* Format parts of the text

This exercise demonstrates how to pull these bits of knowledge together in order to form a rudimentary website.
A list of recipes is presented as context to put forward an exemple of these basic skills.
